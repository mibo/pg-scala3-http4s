# sbt project compiled with Scala 3

Created with `sbt new scala/scala3.g8`

## Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).

## Http4s

Started with [service tutorial](https://http4s.org/v0.23/service/).

Start with `sbt run` and call `http :8080/hello/mibo` (with HTTPie) to get a response.
